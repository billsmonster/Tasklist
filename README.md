This Python script serves as a command-line task management system, enabling users to efficiently add, categorize, complete, and export tasks based on priority levels. 
It utilizes Python’s defaultdict to streamline task organization, offers an intuitive interface for managing tasks, and incorporates the python-docx library to generate
a Word document containing the task list.

## Features

This script is equipped with several key functionalities to enhance productivity.
Users can add tasks and assign them priority levels—High, Medium, or Low—allowing 
for clear organization. Tasks are displayed in a structured manner, sorted by priority and further 
arranged alphabetically for easy reference. Additionally, tasks can be marked as complete and removed from the list once accomplished. 
For future reference, the task list can be exported to a Word document. The script also includes safeguards to ensure smooth user input handling, preventing errors and enhancing usability.
